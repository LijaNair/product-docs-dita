    <conbody>
        <p>Tech comm and marcom have long occupied opposite ends of the content spectrum. The
            stereotype is that tech comm is text-heavy, dense, and badly formatted whereas marcom is
            shiny, beautiful, and content-free. From there, the debate just intensifies:<table

        <p>Give people a friendly interface that lets them quickly narrow down their options and
            choose the one they want. You don’t have to expose all of the fields in the
            database—just the ones that help people narrow down their choices.</p>
